# mini-project-music-recognition
Using hashtables and concepts like , spectrograms and fingerprinting, we use MATLAB to recognise a song from an audio file even with the presence of disturbances like noise and such. This was a project done (but with an existing algorithm) during my 7th semester as a mini project.
